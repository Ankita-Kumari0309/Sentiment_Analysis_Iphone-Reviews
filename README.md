# Project : Sentiment Analysis of iPhone Reviews

## Domain
🌐 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Skills Used
Python, NLP, Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stemming, Polarity, Subjectivity, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Numpy, Pandas

## 📈Project Overview
This project involves cleaning and preprocessing over 10,000 iPhone reviews to ensure accurate analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify patterns and trends within the data. Insights were extracted by performing data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis using libraries including Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Numpy, and Pandas.

## ✅ Results

Sentiment distribution of reviews:

1. Positive Reviews: 78.9% (3,922 reviews)

2. Neutral Reviews: 15.7% (782 reviews)

3. Negative Reviews: 5.3% (265 reviews)

📌 Polarity and subjectivity metrics revealed the overall sentiment to be largely positive.

🤖 VADER sentiment analysis showed a similar result with 80.15% positive sentiment, indicating only a slight variation, likely due to its focus on social media text structures.

✅ Both models aligned in highlighting a strongly positive customer sentiment toward the iPhone product

## 📚 Learnings
🔹 Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens to simplify analysis.

🔹 Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" → "run") to standardize word variations.

🔹 Stemming: Trimming words to their core form by removing prefixes or suffixes (e.g., "jumps" → "jump") for basic normalization.

🔹 Polarity and Subjectivity: Polarity measures the positivity or negativity of text, while subjectivity assesses whether text is opinion-based or factual.

🔹 VADER Model: Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool optimized for social media content.

🔹 The difference in sentiment results between TextBlob and VADER is due to their distinct algorithms and training data, making them suitable for different text types.

## 🔒 Conclusion
Sentiment analysis of iPhone reviews demonstrated a predominantly positive customer perception. The combination of polarity, subjectivity, and NLP preprocessing techniques provided valuable insights into customer feedback. Visualizations such as word clouds and frequency plots highlighted the most common words associated with each sentiment, enabling deeper understanding of customer opinions.
